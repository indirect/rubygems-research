# rubygems-research

This is a rails app intended to make research into the rubygems.org ecosystem easier.

It is publicly accessible at [research.rubygems.info](https://research.rubygems.info/).
The service is hosted on a bare metal hetzner server with 2x 3TB NVMe SSDs, 32 physical cores, and 128GB of RAM.

The goal is to have an index of every single published rubygem and its content, that can be queried in a single place.

I have used this project both to investigate patterns across the ecosystem, as well as assessing the security impact of cross-ecosystem CVEs.
